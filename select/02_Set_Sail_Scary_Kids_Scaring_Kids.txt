Through a stranger's eyes
I take a good look at my life
Only to find that I'm not living
I'm not alive
I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I just wanna try to find myself
We all go, life could end in an instant
We all just disappear
So let me put this into perspective
Let me make this clear
I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I just wanna try to find myself
I've grown tired of the same old fucking story
I think I'm ready for a change
If there's a higher power up there watching over me
Could you give me a sign today, today?
'Cause I've grown tired, I've grown tired
I think I'm ready for a change
I wanna live to tell the tale
I wanna wake up before my ship sets sail
Don't wanna try to be anyone else
I wanna find myself, I wanna find my self
I wanna wake up
(I wanna find myself)
I just wanna wake up
(I wanna find myself)

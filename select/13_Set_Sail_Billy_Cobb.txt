Way hay and up she rises,
Way hay and up she rises,
Way hay and up she rises,
Early in the morning!

Way hay and up she rises,
Way hay and up she rises,
Way hay and up she rises,
Early in the morning!

And we'll row the old chariots along-
And we'll row the old, chariots along
We'll row the old chariots along-
And we'll all hang on behind.
Oh! We'll row the old chariots along-
We'll row the old, chariots along
We'll row the old chariots along-
And we'll all hang on behind.
Well, we'll be alright, if the wind is in our sails-
We'll be alright, if the wind is in our sails-
We'll be alright if the wind is in our sails-
And wе'll all hang on behind.
